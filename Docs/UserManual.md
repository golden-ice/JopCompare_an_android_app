You can enter integer weights for each variable. For bigger weights you assign to a variable, it means it is more important in your comparison. We will use the setting to calculate a score for each job/offer. The formula isï¼š
$AYS + AYB + RS + (RPB * AYS / 100) + (RSUA / 4)$
where:
AYS = yearly salary adjusted for cost of living
AYB = yearly bonus adjusted for cost of living
RBP = retirement benefits percentage
RS = relocation stipend
RSUA = restricted stock unit award

Once you are done with entering the settings, click Save to apply the settings, or click Exit to return to the main menu without saving.
